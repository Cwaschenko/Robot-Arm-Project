# Forward Kinematics 

        Given all Joint Angles Determine the End Position of Manipulatr

## Modular Characteristics
- number of joints
- different orientations
- different actuator sizes (hight and width)
- link lengths between Joints

## Sturcture of Program
```cpp
class ForwawrdKinematics: ForwardKinematics( Arm* 3DOF_Manipulator() )
```
